  # Download Dex
  git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git
  # Build Dex
  cd dex
  make
  make examples
  ```
  Note, the provided `.gitignore` file ignores the `dex` folder.
* Copy the provided `./dex-config/config.yaml` configuration to your dex folder:

* Inside `./dex-config/config.yml`, the front-end application is already registered and CORS is activated. Now that Dex is built and configured, you can start the Dex server:
  ```yaml
  cd dex
  bin/dex serve dex-config/config.yaml
  ```
* Start the back-end
  ```bash
  cd back-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  # Start the back-end
  bin/start
  ```
* Start the front-end
  ```bash
  cd front-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  # Start the front-end (use yarn or npm)
  yarn start
  ```
